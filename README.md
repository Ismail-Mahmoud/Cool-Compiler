# Cool compiler 
 An implementation of the "Classroom Object-Oriented Language" compiler for compiler course in shoubra faculty of engineering  
The files in this directory can get pretty messy, so here is a basic tour:
# Cool Lexer

This directory contains the classes and code for Lexical Analyzer phase 
# Requirement 

 - The lexer  use ANTLRv4. Please follow the quickstart guide [here]([https://www.antlr.org/]).
 - All of the code uses JAVA.

## How to use 

 1. install intelliJ IDEA
 2. install  ANTLRv4.Please follow the quickstart guide [here](https://www.antlr.org/).
 3. to connect intellij with ANTRL see this [video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFMKUtN7rM&feature=emb_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCFMKUtN7rM&feature=emb_logo)).
 4. use your terminal to run the program 


## **Phase 1 : cool Lexer**

-   We first created the Token file which contains all the tokens we want to compile and its possible values
-   mush have installed Antlr on the ide and import antlr runtime jar
-   double click and generate Antlr Recognizer
-   Second we Created controller.java that will test the cool input using tokens and generated files
-   pass test case as an argument to main 

output file called 'file name-lex ' generated in the folder of the project
